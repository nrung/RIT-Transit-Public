# Tiger Transit
The Tiger Transit app will allow students to check the departure and arrival times for the RIT Transit system based on a chosen location and desired destination. The user will select where they want to go to from a drop down menu. The “from” drop down will have a gps location icon next to it to automatically calculate and choose from the dropdown menu the closest shuttle stop. The user can also choose a time in the future to check the schedule. This can be hours or days from now. The time field defaults to the current time. The user then presses submit and receives the times for the next five shuttles arriving at their chosen location of departure based on the time chosen.
